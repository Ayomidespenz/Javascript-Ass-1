## Part 1: Variables and Basic Operations

This section focuses on practicing how to create variables using `const` and `let`, and how to display their values in the console.

### 1. Creating Variables
- **Question**: Create variables to store your name, age, and country.
  - Use `const` for your name and country, and `let` for your age.
  - Display these values in the console using `console.log()`.
