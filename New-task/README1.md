# JavaScript Programming Exercises

### Part 2.1 : JavaScript Data Types
This section focuses on understanding different data types and logging their types using the `typeof` operator.

#### 1. Exploring JavaScript Data Types
Task:
- Declare variables representing different data types:
  - A string (e.g., "Hello, World!").
  - A number (e.g., 42).
  - A boolean (e.g., true).
  - An object (e.g., { name: "Alice", age: 25 }).
  - An array (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
  - `null` and `undefined` values.
- Use `console.log()` and the `typeof` operator to display the type of each variable.

### Part 3: JavaScript Functions
This section focuses on writing and using functions to perform tasks dynamically.

#### 1. Separate Functions for Arithmetic Operations
## Task:
## Write the following functions:
- That takes two numbers and returns their sum.
- That takes two numbers and returns their product.
- That takes two numbers and subtracts them.
- Call each function with different numbers and log the results in a user-friendly format.

#### 2. Function to Greet a User
Task:
- Write a function `greetUser(name)` that takes a name as an argument and returns a greeting message.
- The function should return a message like "Hello, [name]! Welcome to JavaScript programming!".
- Call the function with your name and log the output.

#### 3. Checking Data Types with a Function
Task:
- Write a function `logDataType(value)` that takes any value as an argument.
- Inside the function, use `typeof` to determine the data type and log the result in a user-friendly format.
- Example output: "The type of 42 is number" or "The type of 'hello' is string".
- Call the function with different types of values to test.


### Use document.getElementById to display the result of each operation in the UI. Ensure you have an HTML element with the appropriate ID to show the results.

#### 4 Function to Multiply a Number by Itself (Square a Number)
***Task**:
  - Write a function squareNumber(num) that:
  - Takes a number as input.
  - Returns the square of that number (multiply the number by itself).

  e.g  `console.log(squareNumber(5)); // Output: 25`

#### 5 Function to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
**Task:**

  - Write a function calculateArea(length, width) that:
  - Takes two numbers representing the length and width of a rectangle.
  - Returns the area (length Ã— width).
    e.g ``console.log(calculateArea(4, 5)); // Output: 20``


#### 6 Function to Convert Minutes to Seconds
**Task:**

  - Write a function minutesToSeconds(minutes) that:
  - Takes a number of minutes.
  - Converts and returns the equivalent seconds.
``console.log(minutesToSeconds(5)); // Output: 300``
